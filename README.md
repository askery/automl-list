## Use Case
- We have used TPOT as a final meta-learner step to blend the classification/regression outputs of many MLPs: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.07069.pdf
- We compared the performance of TPOT, Auto-Keras, Auto-PyTorch and auto-sklearn vs step-by-step creation of some common algorithms: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.08118.pdf
- We have used TPOT as the ML main tool in a supervised project to unveil some galaxies properties: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.01185.pdf
- We have also combined some AutoML tools such as Pycaret/TPOT and Auto-Keras/TPOT to achieve improved performance.
